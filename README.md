# Application

This application has been deployed on Elastic Beanstalk at: http://flask-env.eba-tx2zpsgj.ca-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

# How to use the RESTful api

To use the api, send a GET request to the above link and the request must contain the following in its body:
- A dictionary of key-value pairs 
- Each key is of string type
- The value is a string containing the text that is to be evaluated as Fake News or Real News
- The value cannot be an empty string, otherwise an error message is returned
- The body must be in JSON format (the api does not accept non-JSON content!)

Note that URL-query parameters will not be read by the api!

# Response from the RESTful api

The api returns the following upon success:
- Status Code: 200
- A dictionary of key-value pairs
- Each key corresponds to a key from the request body
- Each value is an integer corresponding to the text being predicted as Fake (1) or Real (0)
- The response body is in JSON format as well.

Upon a bad request (i.e non JSON format or empty string), the api returns the following:
- Status Code: 400
- A single key-value pair
- The key is the string "Error"
- The value is the string containing an error message

# Testing
The testing code can be found under /tests and it involves running the application as `python test_application.py` (Note: do not run it using pytest!). 

The test has asserts to check for failure so if the test does not return any visible output on the command line, then it has passed.

The output of the test is sent to the output.log generated by the program (Note: for each run, delete the log otherwise the results will be concatenated!).
